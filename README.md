consilium blog r scripts

This is my playground for learning octopress, markdown, rMarkdown, git, github and R.  I already have made so many mistakes, I doubt the code here has any use.

Do not use this code, it is a mess and highly expermental.

The maps folder does go to my blog, which is slightly interesting if you like maps.
